- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs-dev.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=ru&_x_tr_hl=ru&_x_tr_pto=sc)
- [aos] (https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - library for smooth animations of elements appearance

### What I learned

### Continued development

I didn't really like this small app and a process of development due to some circumstances, so I am not going to continue a development. So I am going to focus on other projects.
